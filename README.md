# build-and-test

For every software repo in the world, you should be about to clone it onto a clean machine and run the "build and test" script at the root and it just works. 

No need to install something else first.

No need to understand how to invoke whatever build system it uses. 

Here you will find repos that demonstrate techniques for making this happen.
